global K r R_m alpha mu gamma

K = 108; %ug N/L - carrying capacity of phytoplankton
% ug N/L = micrograms of atomic nitrogen per litre
r = 0.3; %per day - maximum growth rate of phytoplankton
R_m = 0.7; % per day - maximum specific predation rate
alpha = 5.7; % ug N/L - how quickly R_m is attained as P increases
mu = 0.012; % per day - rate of zooplankton removal
gamma = 0.05; % biomass consumed:biomass of new herbivores
